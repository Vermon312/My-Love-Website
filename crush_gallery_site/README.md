# Our Moments – I love you Andrea

A lightweight, private photo gallery you can deploy in seconds.

## How to use
1. Put your photos in the `images/` folder. Keep the filenames simple (e.g., `photo1.jpg`).
2. Open `index.html` and duplicate one of the `<figure class="card">...</figure>` blocks for each photo, updating the `src`, `alt`, and caption.
3. (Optional) Replace `assets/hero.jpg` with a banner image (1600x900 recommended). If not, the gradient will still look fine.

## Quick deploy (no code)
- **Netlify Drop**: go to https://app.netlify.com/drop and drag the whole folder.
- **Vercel**: create a new project, import from your folder.
- **GitHub Pages**: push to a repo, enable Pages (deploy from `main` branch root).

## Make it temporary (24 hours)
- After a day, **delete the deployment** (Netlify/Vercel) or the **repo** (GitHub Pages).
- For auto-expiry, you can instead paste the `index.html` content into a temporary host like `temp.pm` (set to 24 hours), but image hosting will still be needed.

## Privacy & consent
Only publish photos you have the right to share and where **everyone in the photos agrees**. Keep links private if it’s just for you two.

— Made with ❤️
